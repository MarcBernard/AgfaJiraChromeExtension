Agfa Jira is a Google Chrome extension that adds handy actions to a
Jira issue page.  You can access the actions via the extension icon,
or by using keyboard shortcuts.  The default shortcuts are listed
below:

* Email issue <kbd>Alt+S</kbd> (mnemonic: "send")
* Copy Link as Markdown <kbd>Alt+L</kbd>
* Copy Title <kbd>Alt+T</kbd>

You can always choose your own shortcuts at the bottom of the Chrome
Extensions page.

It's tied to the Jira server at Agfa Healthcare, so won't work on
other Jira instances.
